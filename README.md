# Campaign and Admission Performance Analysis

## Table of contents

### Project Overview
The objective of this project was to analyze the campaign and admission performance of Deployad and Primus across various regions and courses. Deployad campaigns were conducted in Malappuram (specifically Mancheri, Perinthalmanna, and Nilambur), Kozhikode, Hyderabad, and the UAE, targeting courses such as Data Analytics, Data Science, HR, SAP, Digital Marketing, Diploma, and others. Primus focused mainly on SAP-related courses including FICO and MM. The analysis evaluated campaign effectiveness, course-wise performance, counselor efficiency, and regional trends. The project also highlighted the best-performing counselors, admission sources, and regions, offering data-driven recommendations to optimize future marketing strategies and improve return on investment.

### Data Sources
This project is based on two key datasets:

1. Campaign Data – Contains detailed information on marketing campaigns conducted by Deployad and Primus across various regions. It includes data such as campaign type, course targeted, region, status (active/inactive), campaign spend, and performance metrics like conversion rates and cost per result.

2. Admission Data – Includes course-wise and counselor-wise admission records, admission sources (e.g., leads, calls, WhatsApp), fee collected, and region-wise distribution. This dataset was used to evaluate the effectiveness of campaigns in terms of actual enrollment and revenue generation.

Together, these datasets enabled a comprehensive analysis of marketing effectiveness, course performance, counselor contributions, and region-specific trends.

### Tools
* Microsoft Excel – Used for organizing, cleaning, and exploring raw campaign and admission datasets. Pivot tables and basic formulas were used for initial summaries and data transformation.

* Power BI – Utilized for visualizing key metrics through interactive dashboards, including region-wise and course-wise performance, counselor analysis, and campaign ROI insights.

* Microsoft PowerPoint – Used to present insights, key findings, and recommendations through structured slides for stakeholders.

### Data cleaning/preparation

* Consolidated campaign and admission data from multiple Excel and report files into structured tables.

* Appended and merged campaign and admission datasets using queries to create a unified view of campaign performance against actual admissions and revenue.

* Removed duplicates and filtered out irrelevant records such as inactive/test campaigns or incomplete admissions.

* Standardized column values for consistency, including course names, regions, counselor names, and source categories.

* Handled missing values by imputing logical defaults or excluding non-critical records with excessive nulls.

* Created calculated fields such as:

     * ROI 

     * Cost per Result, Conversion Rate, Revenue per Admission, etc.

* Filtered the final dataset by region, week, and campaign status (active/inactive) to enable focused performance analysis.
